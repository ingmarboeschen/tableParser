# tableParser
Converts HTML-tables and character matrices into a text vector and extracts statistical standard results
Description: Functions to parse content from HTML-encoded tables to a human readable text format by simulating the experience of a screen reader for visually impaired users. 'tableParser' contains several functions to work with HTML-encoded tables, as well as native character matrixes. The functions *table2matrix()*, table2text() and table2stats() can be applied on documents in HTML, HML, XML, CERMXML, as well as DOCX and PDF file format. The table extraction from DOCX files is performed with the function docx2matrix(), tables in PDF documents are extracted with the 'tabulapdf' package. The textual representation of characters in matrix content can be unified with unifyMatrix() before parsing. The function table2stats() extracts tabled statistical results. The function further unifies the parsed text, which is then processed with JATSdecoder::standardStats(), in order to extract all statistical standard results and check the reported and coded p-values for consistency, if possible. Due to the great variability in table structures and complexity, parsing accuracy may vary. For best results, it is recommended to work with simple, accessible, and barrier-free table structures to minimize parsing errors.
