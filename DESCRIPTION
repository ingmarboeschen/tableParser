Description: Functions to parse content from HTML-encoded tables to a human readable text format by simulating the experience of a screen reader for visually impaired users. 'tableParser' contains several functions to work with HTML-encoded tables, as well as native character matrixes. The functions *table2matrix()*, table2text() and table2stats() can be applied on documents in HTML, HML, XML, CERMXML, as well as DOCX and PDF file format. The table extraction from DOCX files is performed with the function docx2matrix(), tables in PDF documents are extracted with the 'tabulapdf' package. Table captions and footers cannot be extracted from tables in DOCX and PDF documents, which reduces the decoding capabilities. The textual representation of characters in matrix content can be unified with unifyMatrix() before parsing. The function table2stats() extracts tabled statistical results. The function then unifies the parsed text and processes it with JATSdecoder::standardStats() to extract all statistical standard results and, if possible, check the reported and coded p-values for consistency. Due to the variability and complexity of table structures, parsing accuracy may vary. To minimize parsing errors, it is recommended to work with simple, accessible, barrier-free table structures.
